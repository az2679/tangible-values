# Tangible Values - Exploring Generosity, Altruism, Cooperation, and Trust in the Digital Realm

**Keywords:** Values, Experimental Games, Digital/3D, Psychology, Reflection

This project is a series of digital experiences aimed to make values more tangible, facilitating reflection about one’s own values. Specifically, this project looks at values of generosity, altruism, cooperation, and trust, and how certain social perceptions can influence those values. Social perceptions include external influences of gratitude and communication and internal influences of deservingness, closeness, power, and similarity to self. The project will involve successive rounds of decision making to questions that are structured after experimental games, such as the Dictator Game, Volunteer Dilemma, Prisoner’s Dilemma, and Trust Game. At the end, the decisions made within the project are analyzed, making comparisons of decisions to observations in research, as well as noting any changes in response to situation factors.
